# COVID-19 Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to an ongoing SQL-based analytics project analyzing COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). It's designed to provide actionable insights through meticulous analysis of infection and mortality rates, vaccination progress, and other pandemic-related metrics globally.

## This repository showcases an in-progress series of SQL queries designed to extract and analyze COVID-19 data from the "Our World in Data" dataset. Through a combination of data extraction, aggregation, and complex calculations, the project offers a multifaceted view of the pandemic's impact on a global scale. The analyses range from calculating death and infection percentages in specific countries like India to comparing infection rates relative to population across different nations. Additionally, the project explores temporal trends in vaccination rates, joins multiple datasets to correlate deaths and vaccine coverage, and calculates the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.

### Key Objectives:
- **Data Retrieval:** Gather detailed COVID-19 metrics for various locations and continents.
- **Infection & Mortality Analysis:** Calculate and analyze death and infection percentages, with a focus on data from India.
- **Comparative Metrics:** Compare countries by infection rates in relation to population size.
- **Vaccination Insights:** Track and analyze vaccination rates and increases over time.
- **Data Correlation:** Merge death and vaccination datasets to derive combined insights.
- **Population Vaccination Percentage:** Compute the rolling total and percentages of populations vaccinated over time.
