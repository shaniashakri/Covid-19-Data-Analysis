COVID-19 Data Analytics Project

This repository showcases an in-progress series of SQL queries designed to extract and analyze COVID-19 data from the "Our World in Data" dataset. Through a combination of data extraction, aggregation, and complex calculations, the project offers a multifaceted view of the pandemic's impact on a global scale. The analyses range from calculating death and infection percentages in specific countries like India to comparing infection rates relative to population across different nations. Additionally, the project explores temporal trends in vaccination rates, joins multiple datasets to correlate deaths and vaccine coverage, and calculates the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.

Key highlights of the project include:

**Retrieval of COVID-19 death data for locations with specified continents.
**Analysis of death percentages and infection rates relative to the population in India.
**Comparison of countries by the highest infection rate compared to their population.
**Identification of countries with the highest death count and the most significant increase in vaccination rates.
**Joining COVID-19 death data with vaccination data for comprehensive insights.
**Use of temporary tables to store and manipulate data for advanced calculations.
